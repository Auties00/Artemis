# Artemis
Artemis is an alternative, and open source, client for [HIDIVE](https://www.hidive.com)
Currently only iOS is supported, but I plan to adapt the UI for iPadOS and TvOS in the future

### Download

Despite trying, I couldn't get Artemis on the App Store as Apple doesn't allow third party clients that use reverse engineered HTTP apis, which is fair enough. 
As I wanted the download to be accessible to non-technical people, I've deployed the app on the [AltStore](https://altstore.io/). 
To install Artemis:

1. Follow the instructions to download [AltStore](https://altstore.io/#Downloads) based on your region
2. Add my repository to the store by clicking the correct link:
   - [AltStore World](https://tinyurl.com/ArtemisWorld)
   - [AltStore PAL](https://tinyurl.com/ArtemisPALVerified)
3. Tap on the Artemis app page from the AltStore and download the app
